# Breakpoints

Breakpoints adjust layout and typography for optimal user experience on different devices.<br />
This ensures easy readability and usability on any screen size.<br />
By establishing breakpoints, designers can create clear hierarchy and organize information for efficient and effective content communication.

## Breakpoint sizes

These tokens roughly translate to the following sizes:

<ul>
  {Object.entries(breakpoints).map((breakpoint) => (
    <li>
      {breakpoint[0]}: <b>&gt; {breakpoint[1]}</b>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>

## Designing with breakpoints

To ensure a design works well on mobile devices, it is crucial for user experience and user interface designers to first create layouts for mobile devices.<br />
By taking a mobile-first approach, which focuses on smaller screens, designers can make sure the design is easily adaptable and accessible while maintaining a consistent flow of information across all devices.
